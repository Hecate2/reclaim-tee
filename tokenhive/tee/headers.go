// Response-header policy for the Hub↔TEE seam.
//
// The TEE forwards a small, fixed allowlist of upstream response headers to the
// Hub in the start frame (see rpc.go), and the signed receipt binds exactly
// that forwarded set (proof.Receipt.ResponseHeadersHash). Two things follow
// from the list being the contract:
//
//   - The Hub may act on a header only if the TEE relayed it, and the receipt
//     proves the relayed set — a header that is not on this list is invisible
//     to the Hub and cannot be passed through or acted on.
//   - The list is deliberately short. Every entry is a header a buyer-facing
//     Hub legitimately needs to shape the response (content type, retry
//     timing, credential health) and that cannot leak anything the seller did
//     not already expose to its own clients. Anything else stays inside the
//     TEE.
